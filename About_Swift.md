## Swift에 대하여

<!-- Swift is a new programming language for iOS, OS X, watchOS, and tvOS apps that builds on the best of C and Objective-C, without the constraints of C compatibility. -->Swift는 C 언어 호환성의 속박에서 벗어나 C와 Objective-C 언어의 좋은 점을 기반으로 만들어진 iOS, OS X, watchOS, 그리고 tvOS용 앱을 위한 새로운 언어입니다. 
<!-- Swift adopts safe programming patterns and adds modern features to make programming easier, more flexible, and more fun. --> Swift는 안전한 프로그래밍 패턴을 채용했으며 프로그래밍을 더 쉽고, 유연하고, 재미있게 만들어주는 현대적인 특징들(modern features)을 더했습니다. 
<!-- Swift’s clean slate, backed by the mature and much-loved Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, is an opportunity to reimagine how software development works. --> 성숙하고 많은-사랑을 받고 있는 코코아와 코코아 터치 프레임워크를 기반으로, 둔 Swift의 오점 없는 훌륭한 경력은, 소프트웨어 개발 방법을 재고해볼 기회를 제공합니다.

Swift has been years in the making. Apple laid the foundation for Swift by advancing our existing compiler, debugger, and framework infrastructure. We simplified memory management with Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). Our framework stack, built on the solid base of Foundation and Cocoa, has been modernized and standardized throughout. Objective-C itself has evolved to support blocks, collection literals, and modules, enabling framework adoption of modern language technologies without disruption. Thanks to this groundwork, we can now introduce a new language for the future of Apple software development.

Swift feels familiar to Objective-C developers. It adopts the readability of Objective-C’s named parameters and the power of Objective-C’s dynamic object model. It provides seamless access to existing Cocoa frameworks and mix-and-match interoperability with Objective-C code. Building from this common ground, Swift introduces many new features and unifies the procedural and object-oriented portions of the language.

Swift is friendly to new programmers. It is the first industrial-quality systems programming language that is as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language. It supports playgrounds, an innovative feature that allows programmers to experiment with Swift code and see the results immediately, without the overhead of building and running an app.

Swift combines the best in modern language thinking with wisdom from the wider Apple engineering culture. The compiler is optimized for performance, and the language is optimized for development, without compromising on either. It’s designed to scale from “hello, world” to an entire operating system. All this makes Swift a sound future investment for developers and for Apple.

Swift is a fantastic way to write iOS, OS X, watchOS, and tvOS apps, and will continue to evolve with new features and capabilities. Our goals for Swift are ambitious. We can’t wait to see what you create with it.
